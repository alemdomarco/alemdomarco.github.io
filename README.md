My blog about programming at http://amihaiemil.com

I'm trying to write a new article once a month on topics concerning mostly Object Oriented Programming (heavily influenced by the [EO Paradigm](https://www.elegantobjects.org/)), but also RESTful Web Services, Unit/Integration/UI Testing and DevOps. See the [About](https://www.amihaiemil.com/aboutme/about.html) page for a selection of the best articles to read.

Most of the ideas I write about are also put in practice in my opensource projects so, no matter how crazy some of them they sound, you can see for yourself that they are indeed working.

If you like some of my ideas and would like me to review your project, consider [hiring me](https://www.amihaiemil.com/hireme/hire.html).
