My name is Marco, I'm a software developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
I'm writing this blog to learn and also give back to the community with my toughts and experience.

My main interest is code quality and maintainability so you probably will read a lot about this topic here, my main goal is to write one new article a month but it's something that can flutuate a little.
