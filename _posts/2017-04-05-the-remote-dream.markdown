preview: A brief explanation of what I understand by the words "remote work"

Ever since I started contributing to opensource and more frequently since I started
sharing articles on LinkedIn, HR people are contacting me with remote work
opportunities. Besides that, I usually keep an eye open for companies offering this kind
of employment.

The job descriptions always sound interesting, especially emphasizing
on the work/free time balance. What bothers me, though, is that they always contain the following three things (expressed in one way or another):
"working from home", "full-time" and "attending Skype calls or video meetings"

I personally see absolutely no difference between an offer like the ones described above
and one that requires you to be in the office from 9 to 5. I would even
say that the office is a better alternative.

Where is the gained value? Maybe you save 1h a day because you don't have to actually go
to the office. Other than that, the picture I have in mind is rather sad: instead of being in the office 8h a day,
you're spending the same amount of time alone, in your living room. Communication with your
colleagues becomes a lot harder because you are not close to one another (plus, maybe there is a big timezone difference).
Add the motivation issue to all this: anyone sitting on their couch is less inclined to be productive
than someone sitting in an office. And, who knows, maybe you stumble across an employer who decides
that it's a good and ethical idea to install key loggers and printscreen software on your machine.

My point is that this kind of remote work is **an illusion**. It only makes you
less active, lonelier and overall more stressed, while stealing the same amount of time.
Again -- being glued to a desk is the same as being glued to a couch. I hope you don't imagine
that someone has ever opened their laptop at the beach, under a palm tree.

I think that the real problems are: 1) full-time, committed, schedule and 2) meetings/calls with the colleagues.
As long as you have one of these two, you will be nowhere near the advertised freedom. I assume the full-time part is already clear, so
here's what I don't like about having to call my colleagues: I have to wrap my schedule around it; I cannot do anything on
Tuesdays because at 2pm I have to attend one of those useless, money-milking telcos. I also cannot rely on a Thursday, without my laptop, because my phone will most likely ring: "Hey, could you help us a little, Joe does not understand something here...".

What is the solution? A freelancer-client relationship, rather than an employee-employer one.
But I'm not talking about a classical one where someone hires a consultant, they spend hours
discussing, making plans and comming up with some blunt requirements. I, as a developer, expect
to come to you and hear something like: *"Please, implement this method and unit test it"* or *"Design this new functionality based on these interfaces"* (see <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2009/03/04/pdd.html" target="_blank">PDD</a>), instead of
*"I have this idea of an application and bla bla bla"*. If you don't have a clear project, with a well-defined
set of tasks, then we'll inevitably end up in a "long-term relationship", which translates to fake remote work.

In order for work to be truly remote, **the project has to be split up in many tiny pieces**,
tasks that any developer could implement fast! The ideal workflow is as follows:

   * I get an email containing the task;
   * I provide the solution or the outline, if the task is too big (creating smaller tasks for continuing implementation)
   * Code review, discussion and changes (right there, in the ticket's comments);
   * The solution is accepted;
   * I get an email from PayPal saying that the payment has arrived for said task;
   * End of story;

Now, sometimes I might take on more tasks or leave them to other developers if I don't have time or simply don't feel like solving them.
Since the tasks are small, I do not become a 'God developer' for the project -- the client doesn't suffer from my absence,
he simply forwards the task to another developer.

To sum up, this is pretty much what I would expect from a remote client: no fixed schedule,
no commitment and no tracking; just **clear tasks, payment per deliverable and as little wasted time as possible**.
If I had ten or fifteen such clients, I would be the happiest developer, but unfortunately <a href="http://www.teamed.io" target="_blank">Teamed</a> is the only
company with such a workflow that I could find so far. If you happen to know other similar
companies, don't hesitate to let me know in the comments.
