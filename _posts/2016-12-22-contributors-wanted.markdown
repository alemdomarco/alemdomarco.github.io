preview: A chance to practice pure oop while contributing to fun projects!
---

I started contributing to opensource almost a year ago while working with [Teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io/).
In the meantime I also started my own projects which are all out in the open, on [Github](https://www.github.com/amihaiemil).
Some worth mentioning are: a webcrawler, an evolutionary algorithm framework and a Github chatbot.

Now, when all of them have a pretty solid shape, I am looking for contributors.
This is not only because I don't have enough time to take care of everything, but also
because I believe if a project doesn't have more contributors, it is not known and so
it won't fly for too long (if it ever takes off, that is).

Besides the existing ones, I also have other ideas which I think would be cool to
implement. The latest one I had was an object-oriented YAML parser for Java.
There is already [one](http://jyaml.sourceforge.net/) but it's old and not maintained anymore.

Here are some details about the workflow:

* [PDD](http://www.yegor256.com/2009/03/04/pdd.html) should always be used
* DevOps routines, including merging of PRs are done by [rultor](http://www.rultor.com)
* Puzzles in the code are turned into Github Issues and eventually closed by [0pdd](http://www.0pdd.com/)
* Nothing is to be left without a unit test. e.g. If you have a task asking you to implement a method it is
understood that also at least one unit test is expected.
* Small tasks: 30min to 1h estimation. If the task is too big or defined in a very abstract manner, outline the
solution and puzzle the rest of the job out.

Key technologies: **java**, but also others are welcomed. **e.g.** I myself would like to have a chance
to learn Ruby, so if you have an idea of a cool Ruby library, we could work on it together, and you would
play the archtiect role.

This chance is for every developer that has at least a medium knowledge of OOP and wants to learn something
and exercise their knowledge **outside college or the 9-to-5 office routine**.

So, if you're interested, drop me a line and we'll talk.
