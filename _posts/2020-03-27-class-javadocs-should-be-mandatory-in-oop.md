Well, the title is a bit of a lie. I actually believe JavaDocs are necessary everywhere: methods, attributes and classes.
But let's focus on classes for now. I should also mention that this idea applies to all object-oriented programming languages.
I am talking about JavaDocs becuase I'm a Java guy.

There are many different opinions about the importance of JavaDocs. Some find them rather useless, some use them only in libraries,
and some might even not have an idea what they are. I believe they are useful and should be mandatory in all object-oriented software. 
They are important in order for objects to be used correctly and they are also an indicator of the architecture's quality.
