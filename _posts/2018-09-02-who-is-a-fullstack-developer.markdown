These days it is very common to see the job title "Fullstack Developer" on LinkedIn.
Job adverts, developers or even wannabe developers are using this term quite a lot. Recruiters are looking for that jack of all trades while programmers are bragging about mastering the whole palette of technologies that usually goes into an application.

Knowing I am a little against the current, you've probably guessed that I don't like
this "position". I believe that such a person will be at best mediocre in what they do. I am surely not the only one who thinks this way, but let me just explain my reasoning.

**Disclaimer:** I am not criticising multi-faceted developers: as an experienced back-end developer you should also know how the JS client calls your API or be able to change a datepicker on the UI. However, being able to understand and maybe maintain all the parts of an application is completely different than writing an entire application start-to-finish. This post is about the developers that say they can do the latter and do it well.

To start, I assume that a Fullstack Developer will claim they are proficient (senior level) in both the front and the back-end. They won't admit that they [burned some steps], since that would prove the very point of this article. Now, let me tell you what I understand by "Senior Developer" and then it should be clear why I believe a single person cannot master everything.
