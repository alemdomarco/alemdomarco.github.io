Do you like some of the ideas presented on this blog? Do you happen to have a Java project
that you think might benefit from a 3rd party technical review?

Check out my [projects](https://amihaiemil.github.io/projects.html), see how they are built and maintained. I can:

  * help you make your code more object-oriented, thus increasing maintainability and testability;
  * help you design Java libraries, REST clients, reusable packages etc.
  * give hints related to the overall architecture, including deployment and dependency management;
  * review your tests, including unit, integration and UI automation test;
  * help you setup a CI/CD pipeline;
  * help you setup your opensource project.

If you think the above would help you, write me an <a title="Feel free to drop me a line" href="mailto:{{site.email }}">e-mail</a>! My hourly rate is $50, but I am open to negotiation.
