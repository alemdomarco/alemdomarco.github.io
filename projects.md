I am the architect and main developer of a number of opensource projects. They are
written in Java 7/8 and Java EE 7, with strong OOP principles in mind. These projects are usually the basis of
the articles on this blog, meaning that I tried most of the ideas that I write about and saw that they are indeed applicable.

You can find them under my [Github profile](https://github.com/amihaiemil) or in one of these two organizations: [opencharles](https://github.com/opencharles) and [decorators-squad](https://github.com/decorators-squad).

Some worth mentioning are:

  * Java OOP web crawler (see [Project Charles](https://amihaiemil.github.io/2016/12/05/project-charles.html))
  * Github chatbot for indexing and searching [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) websites ([charles-rest](https://github.com/opencharles/charles-rest))
  * Java OOP YAML parser ([eo-yaml](https://github.com/decorators-squad/eo-yaml))
  * Java 8 Wrapper of Docker's API ([docker-java-api](https://github.com/amihaiemil/docker-java-api))
  * Github chatbot for DevOps/CI/CD automations ([comdor](https://github.com/amihaiemil/comdor))

If you find one of these projects interesting, feel free to contribute
either by filing Issues or by providing a Pull Request (ideally no more than 5 changed files, including tests).
